<ul>
<li>People focus in order on
<ul>
<li>Outcomes: I want to be 20 pounds skinner</li>
<li>Process: How do I become 20 pounds skinners</li>
<li>Identity: I won't look good until I'm 20 pounds skinner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focusing on outcomes first is detrimental because you will view yourself negatively until you reach that outcome
<ul>
<li>No happiness unless outcome occurs</li>
<li>If you fail it will compound negatively</li>
<li>Even if you succeed you may create a new outcome that limits your happiness again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You need to first change your identity</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Every action is like a vote for the type of person you want to become</li>
<li>Process
<ul>
<li>Decide who you want to be
<ul>
<li>Great at health, golfing, basketball, coding, entrepreneurship, speaking, listening  
<ul>
<li>Who could achieve all of this? The author of this book</li>
<li>What would this person do?
<ul>
<li>Would a healthy person uber or walk to the train?</li>
<li>Would a someone who wants to be better at both basketball and golf focus on their strength or core and endurance when working out</li>
<li>Would a coder give up on this leetcode problem or try to figure out the solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prove it to yourself with small wins
<ul>
<li>Every small step, taking the train instead of ubering for example, reinforces the mindset that you are that person you want to be. </li>
<li>Different outcomes can relate to each other.
<ul>
<li>Being healthy can start with better sleep schedule which in turn improves fitness levels for sports and mental level for coding and speaking and listening</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
