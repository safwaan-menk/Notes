<ul>
<li>habit forming is like compound interest. As time goes on your QOL will increase exponentially</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/Notes/assets/images/resultsvstime.png" alt="Results vs Time" style="width:700px;"></p>
<ul>
<li>1% better each day = 37 times better in a year</li>
<li>Positive Compounding
<ul>
<li>Productivity - incorporating small tasks in your routine allows your brain to automate them leaving less need to spend energy on doing these tasks and more energy to explore in other areas</li>
<li>Knowledge - Incorporate the mentality of lifelong learning </li>
<li>Relationships - People reflect your behavior back to you. The better you are genuinely as a person, the better people will be to you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Negative Compounding
<ul>
<li>Stress Compounds - constant little stress daily compounds into serious health issues</li>
<li>Thoughts - the more you think negatively about yourself the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way</li>
<li>Anger - the more frustrated and angry you get over things daily the more you are training yourself to have outrages and outbursts </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Imagine an ice cube melting. It starts out at 26 degrees then slowly moves to 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 degrees. There is barely any noticeable change in the ice. Once it hits 32 degrees you see tge ice start to melt. 
<ul>
<li>Summary: From 26-31 was no change but just from 31 to 32 there was a difference even though going from 31 to 32 is no different than going 27 to 26.</li>
<li>Moral: Habits don't make a huge difference right away but implementing good habits daily will eventually unleash a drastic positive change</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Winners and losers have the same goals</li>
<li>Achieving a goal is only a momentary change</li>
<li>Goals restrict your happiness: putting goals in the way of happiness is a bad cycle. You either are successful and are temporarily happy and stop trying or you fail and disappoint yourself and start to compound that failure. A system of always improving in any aspect instead of having a goal overall will ensure lifelong improvement. Narrow vision of happiness </li>
<li>Goals are at odds with long term progress: same as ^</li>

<ul>
<li>Habits are like compound interest</li>
<li>Can also compound negatively</li>
<li>Small changes appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. Patience is required.</li>
<li>Focus on systems over goals</li>
<li>You don't rise to the level of your goals you fall to the level of your systems.</li>
