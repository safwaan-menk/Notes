- video timer
	- See total elapsed time someone watched a video
	- See how many times a user fast forwarded in a video
	- example: I post a 10 minute comedic video and generally see people are skipping through the same bit. By seeing this I can improve or replace that bit and see where users are actually enjoying my video.
